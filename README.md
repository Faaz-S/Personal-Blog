# Blog

All cool devs have a blog. I want to be a cool dev, therefore I made a blog: [click here](https://blog-faaz.netlify.app/).

## tech stack (from low to high abstraction)

- TypeScript: JavaScript but with static typing.
- [React]
- [Tailwind CSS]
- [Gatsby]

## getting started

- clone the repo
- `npm install`
- `npm run develop`
- open `localhost:8080` in your browser and see it change as you modify your code!
