# Blog v2
All cool devs have a blog. I want to be a cool dev, therefore I made a blog: [blog.faaz](https://blog.faaz/).

Why v2? Because I had another blog project that was an eyesore. This one looks decent (and uses TypeScript).

## tech stack (from low to high abstraction)
- TypeScript: Literally just JavaScript but with static typing.
- [React](https://react.dev/): The go-to framework to make abstract UI components.
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/): Awesome implementation of atomic CSS.
- [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/): features specifically for making blogs (e.g. writing blog entries in Markdown!)

## getting started
- clone the repo
- `npm install`
- `npm run develop`
- open `localhost:8080` in your browser and see it change as you modify your code!
