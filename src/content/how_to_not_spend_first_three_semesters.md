I’ve seen many people successfully navigate to the realm of big tech while the majority was busy with their BS. Here’s everything you should not do.

# Online tutorials

Unless there’s proper application knowledge to complement your learnings any online program is an utter waste of time. You can 'study' hours and hours through these online videos and still end up gaining nothing when you are done. So I recommend instead of this get your hands dirty with each new thing that you learn.

# Part-time work

This REALLY depends on your financial situation. If you’re going to college in a different city and your family can't help you out, you really don’t have a choice. But if you do, DON’T.

Universities like to advertise on-campus work as a way to “build your resume” and “make new conections”. Recruiters will laugh at you if they see anything like this on your resume. It only shows that you have absolutely no worthwhile experience / projects.

The only people you’ll meet is more broke people. Nothing more.

# Taking too many classes to get out early

You think taking 18 credit hours is a flex? It’s not. Getting a dope internship is a flex, and the way to get dope internships is to do a ton of side-projects and attend all the in-person networking events. A heavy schedule just obliterates any chances of you doing any of these two.

And guess what? Getting out a year earlier means you just voluntarily threw out internship opportunities (assuming you’re doing a typical 4-year degree).

Make your foundation strong and don;t run after every new framework you see.

I hope you learned something today :)
