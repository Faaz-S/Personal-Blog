title: "How this project came to be"

It was only when I migrated to using Obsidian instead of OneNote that I realized how large my collection of notes had become. This, my desire to share my knowledge (without actually spending time teaching people), and my need for a new side-project sparked a sequence that led to the creation of the site you are seeing here.

Hopefully Subsequent content will be much longer. I'll try my best to not lose motivation...
